# typeracer-bot
This is a bot for http://typeracer.com created with Python.
Go to http://www.seanwrona.com/typeracer/texts.php and join a race. After you've seen the text, quickly open the previous tab and look for the text using CTRL+F by putting a few beginning words. After you've found it, quickly open it and copy the whole text and paste it into the bot and then run it.
It'll wait for 3 seconds for you to go back to the typeracer page.
Enjoy!
